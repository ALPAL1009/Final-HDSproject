        <h1>About Us<br><br></h1>


        <div id="font1">

            Joe and Emily Herold are the proud owners of their remodeling company called Home Design Solutions. They are based in &nbsp; Phoenix, Arizona
            who specialize in upgrading existing bathrooms and kitchens. Since 2007, the goal has always been to serve customers by providing the
            easiest and most enjoyable experience. The planning period in remodeling these homes could take several days or weeks, but in the end
            it's absolutely worth it. HDS members never rush their clients in making decisions about their new home, instead they will remain at
            the table until a full understanding has been agreed upon and the project plan is under way. The company plans on growing, while
            offering various types of services to clients. Once hiring HDS, all expectations will be exceeded as well as a new lifestyle
            for their customers. The owners have 5 store locations across Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada with almost 40 employees bringing
            high-quality in the remodeling and design of kitchens and bathrooms. <br><br>


            Home Design Solutions is your professional source for interior design services. We are your advocate in dealing with general contractors,
            architects, remodelers, and suppliers. Our years of experience have forged outstanding working relationships with professionals that support
            our methodology for completing projects. That includes a strict attention to detail while adhering to the client's desires and tastes.
            If you have remodeled before, then you know that the process is as important as the project. We want to be seen in the top tier of remodeling
            contractors competing for the most prestigious work in town, based on our reputation and our process that includes design and attention
            to detail. We understand that we are coming into your home, so we respect your ideals for what your dream home should be.
